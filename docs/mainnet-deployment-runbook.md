## Pre-deployment Checklist

Complete every item before building the wasm artifact.

- [ ] All CI checks pass on the commit you intend to deploy
      (`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, `stellar contract build`,
      `cargo audit`).
- [ ] The CHANGELOG has an entry for this release under a dated version heading.
- [ ] The `fee_recipient` address is a multisig or hardware-wallet-backed account
      (not a hot key).
- [ ] The `admin` address is a multisig or hardware-wallet-backed account.
- [ ] You have confirmed the mainnet USDC asset's SAC address
      (canonical Stellar USDC contract address for the Stellar mainnet network).
- [ ] The deployer keypair has enough XLM to cover contract deployment and
      initialization transaction fees (recommend ≥ 10 XLM as a buffer).
- [ ] You have a monitored Stellar RPC endpoint for mainnet.
- [ ] Rollback plan reviewed (see [Rollback Procedure](#rollback-procedure)).

## Build the Release Artifact

```bash
cd intent_settlement

# Ensure the wasm32 target is present
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Clean and build optimized wasm
cargo clean
stellar contract build
```

Confirm the artifact was produced:

```bash
ls -lh target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/vortex_intent_settlement.wasm
```

Note the file hash — you'll compare it against the on-chain stored hash after
deployment:

```bash
sha256sum target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/vortex_intent_settlement.wasm
```

### Alternative: Download from GitHub Release

For reproducible verification without rebuilding, download the verified `.wasm`
binary and `SHASUMS256.txt` from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/stellar-vortex-protocol/vortex-contracts/releases)
corresponding to the version tag you're deploying:

```bash
# Download SHASUMS256.txt from the release
curl -L https://github.com/stellar-vortex-protocol/vortex-contracts/releases/download/v1.0.0/SHASUMS256.txt -o SHASUMS256.txt

# Download the wasm binary
curl -L https://github.com/stellar-vortex-protocol/vortex-contracts/releases/download/v1.0.0/vortex_intent_settlement.wasm -o vortex_intent_settlement.wasm

# Verify checksum
sha256sum -c SHASUMS256.txt
```

This binary is built deterministically using Rust 1.78.0 and can be independently
verified to match the source code at that tag — no local build required.

---

## Deploy the Contract

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/vortex_intent_settlement.wasm \
  --source <DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY> \
  --network mainnet
```

The CLI prints the newly assigned `CONTRACT_ID`. Record it immediately — this
is the canonical address for the entire deployment:

```
CONTRACT_ID=<paste the output here>
```

> **Security note**: The deployer key is only needed for this step. After
> `initialize` is called with a separate `admin` address, the deployer key
> has no special privileges over the contract.

---

## Initialize the Contract

`initialize` can only be called once. Calling it a second time panics with
`AlreadyInitialized (1)`. Get the parameters right on the first attempt.

### Parameters

| Parameter       | Expected value                                      |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `admin`         | Multisig/hardware-wallet Stellar address            |
| `fee_recipient` | Address that receives protocol fees and slash proceeds |
| `bond_token`    | Mainnet USDC SAC address                            |

### Verify the bond_token address

Before invoking `initialize`, double-check the USDC contract address using a
read call you can verify independently:

```bash
# The address should resolve to "USDC" with issuer GAULP... on mainnet.
# Cross-reference with Stellar Expert or the Circle/Stellar documentation.
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <USDC_SAC_ADDRESS> \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  symbol
```

### Call initialize

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ADMIN_SECRET_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --fee_recipient <FEE_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> \
  --bond_token <USDC_SAC_ADDRESS>
```

---

## Post-deploy Verification

Run every command in this section and confirm the output matches the expected
value before proceeding. These commands are all read-only (no fees, no side
effects).

### 1. Confirm admin address

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  get_admin
```

Expected: the `<ADMIN_ADDRESS>` passed to `initialize`.

### 2. Confirm fee recipient

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  get_fee_recipient
```

Expected: the `<FEE_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>` passed to `initialize`.

### 3. Confirm bond token

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  get_bond_token
```

Expected: the USDC SAC address passed to `initialize`. Cross-check this output
character-by-character against the address you verified before calling
`initialize`.

### 4. Confirm contract is not paused

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  is_paused
```

Expected: `false`. If this returns `true`, something went wrong — investigate
before continuing.

### 5. Confirm protocol stats are zeroed

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  get_stats
```

Expected: `(0, 0)` — `(total_intents, total_volume)`. Any other value indicates
the contract was previously initialized (possibly by a replay attack or
misconfiguration).

### 6. Confirm allowlist is off by default

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  is_dst_allowlist_enabled
```

Expected: `false`. The allowlist is disabled by default and must be explicitly
opted into via `set_dst_allowlist_enabled`.

---

## Configure the Destination Token Allowlist

If you want to restrict which destination tokens users can request (recommended
for mainnet), configure and enable the allowlist before going live.

```bash
# Allow mainnet USDC as a destination token
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ADMIN_SECRET_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  add_allowed_dst_token \
  --token <USDC_SAC_ADDRESS>

# Add any additional allowed tokens (EURC, etc.)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ADMIN_SECRET_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  add_allowed_dst_token \
  --token <OTHER_TOKEN_ADDRESS>

# Verify each token was added
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  is_dst_token_allowed \
  --token <USDC_SAC_ADDRESS>
# Expected: true

# Enable enforcement
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ADMIN_SECRET_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  set_dst_allowlist_enabled \
  --enabled true

# Confirm enforcement is on
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  is_dst_allowlist_enabled
# Expected: true
```

## Deploy the Fee Router

The `fee_router` contract is the protocol's fee recipient. Instead of sending
fees and slash proceeds to a single address, point `fee_recipient` at the
fee-router contract so revenue is split across governance-configured sinks
(treasury, backstop vault, badge-holder rebate pool, etc.).

### Build the artifact

```bash
cd fee_router
stellar contract build
ls -lh target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/vortex_fee_router.wasm
```

### Deploy and initialize

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/vortex_fee_router.wasm \
  --source <DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY> \
  --network mainnet

FEE_ROUTER_ID=<paste the output here>

stellar contract invoke \
  --id $FEE_ROUTER_ID \
  --source <ADMIN_SECRET_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --weight_delay <TIMELOCK_SECONDS>
```

### Configure sinks and weights

Weights are expressed in basis points and must sum to exactly `10,000`. Weight
changes are timelocked: propose first, then apply after `weight_delay` seconds.
The number of sinks is capped (see `MAX_SINKS` in the contract).

```bash
# Propose a new weight set (sinks + bps, summing to 10_000)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $FEE_ROUTER_ID \
  --source <ADMIN_SECRET_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  propose_weights \
  --sinks '[<TREASURY_ADDRESS>, <BACKSTOP_VAULT_ADDRESS>, <REBATE_POOL_ADDRESS>]' \
  --weights '[5000, 3000, 2000]'

# After weight_delay has elapsed, apply the pending weights
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $FEE_ROUTER_ID \
  --source <ADMIN_SECRET_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  apply_weights

# Verify the active weights
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $FEE_ROUTER_ID \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  get_weights
```

### Point the settlement contract at the router

Set the settlement contract's `fee_recipient` to `$FEE_ROUTER_ID` so all fees
and slash proceeds flow into the router.

### Distribute accumulated fees

`distribute(token)` is permissionless — anyone can call it to pay out the
router's balance for a token according to the active weights. Accounting is
pull-based (`claimable[sink][token]`): if a sink rejects a transfer, its share
is held and can be retried later rather than reverting the whole distribution.
Rounding dust is assigned to the first sink.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $FEE_ROUTER_ID \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  distribute \
  --token <USDC_SAC_ADDRESS>

# Inspect a sink's claimable balance for a token
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $FEE_ROUTER_ID \
  --source <ANY_KEY> \
  --network mainnet -- \
  claimable \
  --sink <TREASURY_ADDRESS> \
  --token <USDC_SAC_ADDRESS>
```
